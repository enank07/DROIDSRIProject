# DROID SRI Project
---
Hello! I'm Enan! Thanks for checking this out 😊! This is part of the Harvard SRI Cohort 2025, the project that I've took on!

## Overview
This repository contains all code, notebooks, model checkpoints and supplementary
data required to reproduce the analyses in **“DROID: a dual‑task deep‑learning
framework that jointly classifies cell identity and SARS‑CoV‑2 infection from
single‑cell transcriptomes.”**

* `codingfiles/` → PyTorch training/inference scripts + step‑by‑step Jupyter notebooks that regenerate every figure &
  table in the manuscript (basically all the code)
* `projectfigures/` → Download all figures from the paper (UMaps, SHAP, etc.)
* `projecttables/` → Download all tables and look at table data from the paper   
* `checkpoints/` → pre‑trained 20‑epoch model (`dual_head_epoch07.pt`) used for all code 
* `data_links.md` → Download links & checksums for the raw CellxGene dataset

Paper dropping soon (will link if published, hopefully)! Email enan.khan96@gmail.com for any questions.
