# DROIDSRIProject
All the code for our Harvard SRI Project (DROID); DROID is a dual-headed MLP architecture that takes in a cell's gene expression profile (scRNA-seq data), and outputs both the cell class and whether the cell has COVID-19 or not (can be switched to other viral pathogens given its lightweight architecture).
